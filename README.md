# SecretWiki

A wiki for sharing data...and secrets.

## Use-Case
If you've ever played a Tabletop RPG you know that there's a lot of information
that needs to get collected and maintained over a game. Characters, locations,
plot points, you name it! But how do you keep track of it all without managing
a public copy for your users and a private copy for yourself? Pay for an
expensive public service? No. Use SecretWiki.
