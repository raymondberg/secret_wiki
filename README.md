# SecretWiki

A wiki for sharing data...and secrets.

## Use-Case

If you've ever played a Tabletop RPG you know that there's a lot of information
that needs to get collected and maintained over a game. Characters, locations,
plot points, you name it! But how do you keep track of it all without managing
a public copy for your users and a private copy for yourself? Pay for an
expensive public service? No. Use SecretWiki.


# Usage

This repo follows Github's Scripts To Rule them All. These scripts will do everything you need to start

```
script/setup
script/test

# In two shells (a temporary solution)
script/server
script/server --frontend
```

## Status

Currently in prototyping with a lot on the table:

- [ ] Data Store
- [ ] User Authentication
- [ ] Owner-level secrets
- [ ] User-level secrets
- [ ] A Nifty Style
- [ ] Test Suite
- [ ] Import/Export functionality
